# Bayesian Change Point Model (BCPM)

BCPM is a hierarchical probability model, more precisely a hidden Markov model, that relates observed features to hidden variables. More specifically, the model tracks a set of latent variables and generates a signal in case of a *change*. The typical applications of BCPM are those in which sudden bursts in temporal data are aimed to be detected.
